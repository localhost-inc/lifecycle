# WorkspaceProvider Interface

The `WorkspaceProvider` is the primary extensibility seam for workspace lifecycle operations. It is the adapter layer between the control plane and the environment where workspaces actually run. Workspace mode is selected **per-workspace** at creation time and stored as `workspace.mode`.

## Interface

```typescript
interface WorkspaceProvider {
  createWorkspace(input) → { workspace, worktree_path }
  startServices(manifest.services, env, secrets) → service_statuses
  healthCheck(manifest.services[].health_check) → pass/fail per service
  stopServices(service_names[]) → void
  runSetup(workspace_id) → void
  sleep(workspace_id) → void
  wake(workspace_id) → void
  destroy(workspace_id) → void
  createTerminal(workspace_id, launch_type, cols, rows, harness_provider?, harness_session_id?) → { terminal, attachment? }
  attachTerminal(terminal_id, cols, rows) → terminal_connection
  writeTerminal(terminal_id, data) → void
  resizeTerminal(terminal_id, cols, rows) → void
  detachTerminal(terminal_id) → void
  killTerminal(terminal_id) → void
  exposePort(workspace_id, service, port) → access_url | null
}
```

Provider-specific runtime detail should not be stuffed into a generic `mode_state` field. If a field materially affects product behavior, model it explicitly on `workspace`; otherwise keep it inside the provider implementation.

## Execution Model

`lifecycle.json` describes **WHAT** to run. The `WorkspaceProvider` decides **WHERE**.

1. All workspaces are lifecycle-managed execution environments backed by a `WorkspaceProvider`.
2. Every workspace supports `share` with team-accessible preview URL (mechanism varies by provider).
3. Org TTL and cleanup are enforced by the control plane regardless of provider.
4. If the target provider's capacity is unavailable, create request is rejected with actionable error.
5. V1 ships both `CloudWorkspaceProvider` and `LocalWorkspaceProvider`. Both are implemented against the `WorkspaceProvider` interface and validated in parallel from Milestone 3 onward.
6. Platform stance is Cloudflare-first for cloud execution, edge routing, and storage integration.

## Terminal Stream Contract (M3+)

Terminal transport is split between control-plane mutations and ordered data streaming.

1. Control-plane operations stay typed and imperative (`create`, `attach`, `write`, `resize`, `detach`, `kill`).
2. Terminal output is an ordered chunk stream, not a coarse app event.
3. Local mode should use Tauri `Channel` for PTY output streaming.
4. Generic app events remain appropriate for terminal metadata/status changes, not high-frequency byte output.
5. Replay buffers are provider-owned implementation detail as long as attach/replay ordering is preserved.

## Mode, Authority, and Aggregation

`workspace.mode` is the authority boundary for workspace lifecycle data.

1. `workspace.mode=local` means the local provider is authoritative for that workspace's runtime state, persistence, and lifecycle operations.
2. `workspace.mode=cloud` means the cloud provider and control plane are authoritative for that workspace's runtime state, persistence, and lifecycle operations.
3. Signing in enables cloud-mode workspaces and sync flows; it does not change the authority of existing local-mode workspaces.
4. Desktop surfaces may present local and cloud workspaces together in one list, but each workspace still has exactly one authoritative provider selected by `workspace.mode`.
5. Mixed-mode workspace lists must be aggregated from normalized domain records, not by composing raw storage-specific rows directly in UI code.
6. Mutations issued from aggregated views must dispatch back to the authoritative provider for the selected workspace.
7. `mode` is a workspace concern. Do not apply it broadly to unrelated entities unless a concrete execution-boundary need emerges.

## `CloudWorkspaceProvider` (V1)

1. Cloud sandbox plane:
   - per-branch Cloudflare Sandbox instances
   - terminal access via sandbox terminal API
   - preview URLs via Cloudflare Workers routing
   - ephemeral test data and fixtures
2. Capacity pools:
   - `standard` pool for default workspace lifecycle
   - optional `boost` pool for expensive or latency-sensitive workloads
3. Warm infrastructure:
   - dependency/image cache surfaces (R2) that reduce create/wake spend and latency

## `LocalWorkspaceProvider` (V1)

1. Local execution plane:
   - local Git worktree checked out on host filesystem
   - Tauri Rust backend handles process supervision, PTY management, Docker integration, and local state persistence
   - localhost ports for service access
2. Requirements:
   - local workspaces operate without network — Convex connection only required for cloud workspaces and fork-to-cloud
   - Tauri desktop app must be running (the Rust backend IS the local process supervisor — no separate daemon)
   - Docker Desktop required for `image` runtime services
